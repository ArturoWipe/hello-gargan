# Hello Gargan

This project is articulated on two aspects:

1. Learning PureScript / Reactix / Toestand
2. Structuring a React project into a pseudo-framework easing the process of writing UI/UX code and global application architecture

> **Why?** When PureScript is envisaged as an evolution of frontend application, we are facing a main issue regarding the libraries to considered. Thermite, Halogen, Concur, React-Basic, etc. are definitely presents, but does not accomodate very well for new learners. Learning curve is tough, code sometimes hard to reason with. Both Reactix and Toestand offer a great addition to this regard. The following will try to continue this aim by proposing few interfaces helping developing frontend application as a whole. This is by no means a coercive opinion, rather a mix of modeste additions.

## Usage

```bash
# install psc-package
yarn add psc-package

# install dependencies
yarn install -D && yarn install-ps
```

```bash
# or use docker
./help.sh stack:reset
```
